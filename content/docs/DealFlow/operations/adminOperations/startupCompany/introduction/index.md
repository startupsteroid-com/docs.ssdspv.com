A startup is a young company or organization that is typically newly established and in the early stages of development. These companies are often founded by entrepreneurs and are characterized by their innovative and entrepreneurial nature. Startups are known for their focus on creating and scaling new products, services, or business models, often in the technology or innovation sectors.

Startups play a crucial role in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and creating jobs in many countries. They are often associated with technology hubs and innovation ecosystems, such as Silicon Valley in the United States, where a significant number of successful startups have emerged. Successful startups can grow into large, established companies over time if they navigate the challenges and risks associated with the early stages of development.
