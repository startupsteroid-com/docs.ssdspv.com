**Tabular Data**

**Tabular Data in DealFlow refers to Startup List data that is organized in rows and columns, much like a table.** *Each row typically represents a record, and each column represents a different attribute or variable related to that record.* Tabular data is commonly found in spreadsheets, relational databases, and CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. In DealFlow the Tabular Data provides various advantages as follows : 
- *Organized Structure*
- *Ease of Understanding*
- *Efficient Storage*
- *Flexibility*
- *Data Analysis and Visualization*
- *Querying and Filtering*

**In Tabular Data you will be able to see the List of all Startups with Count**, along with that you can perform various operations.
  - **Drag a column header here to group by that column**
    : Using this option the **Admin can group various records on the basis of particular column condition.** Admin only have to drag that particular column to mentioned place( as the description given). By clicking the column or arrow, **Admin can also change the records order to ascending or descending.** To get back the original list Admin only have to drag and drop the column to its old place.
  - **Export all data to XLS**
    : Using this option Admin can **download all Startup list in .xls format at once.** That list will contain Startups present in table with all the chosen columns.
  - **Column Chooser**
    : Column Chooser allows the Admin to **select only required columns for view** except viewing all at once.
  - **Search**
    : Search field allows the Admin to **query the required text.** Admin have to just enter the text and relevant search results will appear and get highlighted.
  - **Column Filter**
    : Column filter **allows Admin to get the Startups on the basis of some condition.** On click of column, Admin can *change the order to ascending or descending.*
  - **Column Search**
    : Using this Admin can **search the only specific records on the basis of column value.**
  - **Create Filter** 
     :  Create Filter is **collection of multiple column filter conditions altogether, ** the only difference as compared to column filter is that the Admin can now see multiple column conditions here together. Also *Admin can write conditions there as per requirement.*
    
There are **some other actions that can Admin perform on single Startup or multiple by making selection through Checkbox.** The *functionality for performing actions on single or multiple Startups is same.*
These actions are as follows: 
- Share Startup
- Send Email
- Update Stage
- Update Pool
- Change Eligibility
