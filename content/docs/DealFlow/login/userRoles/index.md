**Significance of User Roles**

**User roles** in a *website or web application help determine the level of access, permissions, and responsibilities that different users have within the system*. The specific roles can vary depending on the website's purpose and functionality, but here are some common user roles you might find in DealFlow:

- Administrator
  : **Administrators have high-level control over the website.** They can manage user accounts, configure site settings, and often have full access to all features and content. They may also have the ability to add or remove other users.

- Entrepreneur 
  :  The role of an entrepreneur in a startup is multifaceted and critical to the success and growth of the business. *Entrepreneurs are often the driving force behind the startup, responsible for not only the initial idea but also the planning, execution, and management of the venture*.

- Investor 
  : Investors play a crucial role in the success and growth of a startup. *Their primary role is to provide financial support and resources to help the startup achieve its goals*.
