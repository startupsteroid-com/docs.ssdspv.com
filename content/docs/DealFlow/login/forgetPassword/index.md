**Why forget Password?**

*"Forgot password"* is a common feature on websites and online services that allows users to reset their passwords if they have forgotten them. It is a security and user assistance measure that helps individuals regain access to their accounts when they can't remember their password.

The significance of the *"Forgot password"* feature includes:

Account Recovery
: When a user forgets their password, they can initiate the password reset process. This typically involves verifying their identity through email, a security question, or other methods. Once their identity is confirmed, they can set a new password and regain access to their account. 

Security
:  This feature is designed to enhance account security. It ensures that only authorized users who can prove their identity are able to reset their password, preventing unauthorized access to accounts.

User Convenience
: Forgetting passwords is a common occurrence, and the *"Forgot password"* feature offers a user-friendly way for individuals to recover their accounts without having to create entirely new ones.

Preventing Unauthorized Access
: It helps prevent unauthorized access to an account even if someone else gains access to your login credentials. Without the ability to reset the password, an unauthorized person would be unable to take control of the account.

In practice, the "Forgot password" process may involve receiving a password reset link via email, answering security questions, confirming a mobile phone number, or using other methods to verify the user's identity.
