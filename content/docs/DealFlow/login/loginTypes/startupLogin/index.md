**Startup Login/Founder Login**

A *"Startup Login or Founder Login"* typically refers to **the process of logging into a company's software applications**, often as an founder or authorized user. The steps for a company login can vary based on the specific setup and security measures put in place by the company.

**Steps you have to follow while making login for DealFlow as founder**

- Open the Login Page/Application
  : Depending on the company's policies, *you might need to open a web browser and navigate to a specific login page or open a dedicated application used for company logins.* In DealFlow click on the link for [Login Page](https://tiesocalangels.spv.today/admin/login).

- Enter Your Credentials
  : On the login page or within the application, **you'll be prompted to enter your credentials**. This typically includes a username (often your EmailId or email address) and a password.

- Submit/Login
  : After entering your credentials and completing any additional authentication steps, *you will typically click the "Login" button to initiate the login process*.

- Access Granted
  : *If your credentials are correct and any additional security checks are passed, you'll gain access to the company's application*. Now you can do various things there, say view or edit company, checkout services and help desk.

- Logout (when done)
  : It's important to *log out of your company account when you're done using it*, especially on shared or public computers.

**Many companies also have policies in place for password complexity, regular password changes, and other security measures to protect sensitive company data.** In case you forget the password please refer this link [Forget Password](https://startupsteroid-com.github.io/docs.ssdspv.com/docs/dealflow/login/login-types/forgetpassword/)
